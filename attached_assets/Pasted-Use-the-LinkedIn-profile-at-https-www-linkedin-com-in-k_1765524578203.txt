Use the LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-v-835047265/
 as the primary source of truth for text, job titles, timeline, skills, education and projects. Create an elegant, white-first design with accent colors blue, light-blue and black, and subtle interactive color tones. The overall look must feel premium, minimal and futuristic.

Visual & UX requirements

Layout & theme

Clean white background as the base with tasteful blue / light-blue / black accents.

Premium, minimal typography and generous white space.

Smooth micro-interactions and subtle motion to feel modern and high-end.

Hero & Brand

Full-width hero with a short intro (name, headline, short tagline) pulled from LinkedIn.

Include a tasteful, animated 3D background (WebGL/Three.js) that is interactive (responds subtly to mouse/scroll/tilt).

Provide an option for reduced motion for accessibility.

Journey visualization

Replace a plain “Experience” list with interactive mindmaps / roadmaps that visualize career progression and major milestones. Each node expands to show details (role, company, dates, achievements and links to projects).

Allow timeline filtering (by year / skill / role).

Projects & Case studies

Highlight 6–10 best projects as interactive case studies with hero image/video, problem, approach, results and tech stack.

Projects accessible from roadmap nodes and a dedicated Projects page.

Include hover or click animations and a modal or dedicated subpage for each case study.

3D & interactive elements

Integrate subtle 3D elements for depth (floating cards, depth parallax, interactive background shapes).

Use Three.js (or equivalent) for the 3D background and small interactive elements (e.g., 3D project previews, animated skill spheres).

UI details

Polished micro-interactions: animated buttons, link underlines, card elevation, transitions.

Responsive grid with careful mobile/desktop parity.

Sticky header with compact nav on scroll.

Dark-accent mode: optional black-accented variant that preserves premium feel.

Accessibility & performance

Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, proper contrast ratios, and reduced-motion options.

Aim for performance: lazy-loading, optimized images, code-splitting, minimal main-thread work for 3D.

SEO & Analytics

Metadata for each page, structured data for Person and Projects, sitemap.xml, robots.txt.

Integrate an analytics tool (Google Analytics / Plausible) and an easy contact form that sends emails (or uses Netlify Functions / serverless).

Content & structure (recommended sitemap)

Home (hero with 3D background, summary, CTA)

About (interactive roadmap/mindmap + full bio pulled from LinkedIn)

Projects / Case Studies (grid + detail pages)

Experience (visual timeline + expanded entries)

Skills (interactive visual: skill clusters, levels, tech stack tags)

Blog / Articles (optional; for thought leadership)

Contact (form, email, social links, downloadable CV/Resume)

Utilities: Privacy Policy, Terms (if needed)

Technical recommendations

Framework: React with Next.js (for SSR/SSG) or SvelteKit; easily hostable on Vercel/Netlify.

3D & animations: Three.js + react-three-fiber OR plain Three.js; GSAP or CSS transitions for UI micro-interactions.

Styling: Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules for maintainability; consider Framer Motion for smooth animations.

CMS (optional): Sanity, Contentful, or Markdown + Git workflow for content updates.

Hosting & deployment: Vercel or Netlify for CI/CD; CDN for assets.

Performance tools: Image optimization (AVIF/WebP), lazy loading, Lighthouse audits.

Deliverables & acceptance criteria

Fully responsive website matching the described visual style and colors (white base; blue / light-blue / black accents).

Interactive 3D background in the hero that is performant and accessible (reduced motion toggle).

Interactive roadmap/mindmap that clearly shows career progression and links to project case studies.

6–10 polished project case studies with images, descriptions and tech stacks.

SEO basics, structured data, analytics and contact form working end-to-end.

Source code in a Git repo with deployment instructions and a README.

A small style guide (fonts, color tokens, spacing, components).

Example design cues & behavior (for inspiration, not imitation)

Minimal, premium portfolios with generous spacing and clean typography.

Subtle depth via 3D geometry and parallax rather than noisy textures.

Roadmap/mindmap interactions similar to career timelines or interactive product journeys.

Tone & copy guidance

Professional, concise, and achievement-focused.

Use active verbs and quantify impact where possible (e.g., “reduced load time by X%”, “improved conversion by Y%”).

Pull exact role titles, dates, summary lines and project names from LinkedIn verbatim; then rewrite shorter, high-impact blurbs for the website.
